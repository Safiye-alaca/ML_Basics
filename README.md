# ML_Basics
This repository contains foundational data science and machine learning projects implemented as part of the courses I completed on the Turkcell GeleceÄŸi Yazanlar platform. The projects aim to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills using libraries such as Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
